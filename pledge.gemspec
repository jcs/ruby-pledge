pledge exposes OpenBSD's pledge(2) system call to ruby, allowing a
program to restrict the types of operations the program
can do after that point.  Unlike other similar systems,
pledge is specifically designed for programs that need to
use a wide variety of operations on initialization, but
a fewer number after initialization (when user input will
be accepted).
